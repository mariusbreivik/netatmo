## 📖 describe()
`netatmo` is a tiny CLI based on the [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
 framework written in [go-lang](https://golang.org/). Its mostly just for fun, but the purpose is retrieving and displaying data in the command line from netatmo weather api.

 </br>

## 🧑‍💻 use()
`netatmo` has several subcommands which can be used to get different data from your Netatmo Weather Station. There is still some work remaining to get all commands working.

### 🌡 temp
 ```shell
$ netatmo temp -o, --outdoor | -i , --indoor
 ```

### 🎧 noise
 ```shell
$ netatmo noise
 ```

### 🌫 co2
 ```shell
$ netatmo co2
 ```

### 💦 humidity
 ```shell
$ netatmo humidity
 ```

### ⚙️ firmware
 ```shell
$ netatmo firmware

 ```
### 📶 wifi

## 📜 develop()
 * You need to have your own [Netatmo Weather Station](https://www.netatmo.com/en-eu/weather/weatherstation) in order to use this CLI
 * Sign up at [netatmo](https://dev.netatmo.com/apps/) and create an app to get `clientId` and `clientSecret` in order to retrieve data from your Netatmo Weateher Station through the API.
  
</br>

 ## 💾 install()
  * Make sure [go](https://golang.org/) is installed
  * Clone this repo
  * install dependencies and build:
```shell
$ go install && go build
```
* create config file called `$HOME/.netatmo.yaml` with this content:
  
```yaml
netatmo:
  clientID: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  clientSecret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
  username: YOUR_NETATMO_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_NETATMO_PASSWORD
```
* If everything is correct should be able to run:
```
